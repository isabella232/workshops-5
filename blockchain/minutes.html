<div id="magicdomid9" class=""><br></div>

<div id="magicdomid12" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>We are working to make a web that is global and interoperable and usable by everyone. If you have tech that you want to work on a global working basis, and distributed manner, then the web is the platform on which to do that. W3C is the consortium and standards body that works to help keep the web open and available. We don't have police power, ew don't have police power to compel web standards, we build consensu sthrough W3C process and our open royalty-free patent policy to invite people to work together.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid13" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid14" class=""><ul class="list-indent1"><li><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>We hve more than 400 member organizations, we have thousands of participants and interest groups to work together and we have a relatively small staff to work wit heveryone. We have about 65 members on our staff to work to facilitate that consensus. We work in working groups. These are the groups that develop the recommendations for the track standards. We also have interest groups and community groups that work in the earliest stages of use-cases and requirements to incubate people. We are governed by ... work and bring people together. We rarely take votes. We much more often are engaging large groups in debate and discussion to figure out what can we live with that will enable ... a rough and readable ... brainstorming, thinking about what does the web need? What does the tech need? Where are places that are public that our membership can work together with the help of our technical staff so that we can facilitate working together and possibly out of that comes the formation of a working group. Possiby out of that comes great conversations that start up around tables here to form tech startups, or go off and incubate in industry or in public interest organizations.</p></span></li></ul></div>
<div id="magicdomid15" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid16" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>One possible development though after that incubation happens after people say, you know what we really need to work together is a common interface, a common API, when we have that level of clarity, we might form a working group. Working group iterates on the proposed standard and sends it out for public comment and invites comment from its participants, moves up to the recommendation track, and after&nbsp; consensus has reached in the working group and among the wide review from the public that might be published as a w3c recommendation. Thta's not saying, again, that we know of any particular recommendation that might come out of here, if we find something, that's whree it will go.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid17" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid18" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>So what are we tthinking of more particularly with the blockchain and the web? There are two different ways that blockchain and web standards can work together. What does the web need to add in order to support blockchain better? That's possibilities like crypto, formats, APIs that could be added to the web to make it easier to access the distributed ledger universally any place that you have a web browser. Easier for the web to interface with those distributed ledgers. And then, conversely, there are opportunities in how can the technologies of blockchain support the web. For example, distributed ledgers supporting certficate transparency? Which is an effort at IETF at the moment, to store the record of certificate issuance on a ledger, publicly transparently so that anyone can check for certificate misissuance.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid19" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid20" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>As Doug mentioned, some things are right for standards. Some things are too early or not yet standard ready. Standards are great for improvement, harmonization and improvement and consensus. If there are already mutliple examples of the ways that something might be done, then we might need to fit three or four of them together into the same framework. When they are already working examples from which to derive a consensus, patterns to match to bring a standard reportoire. Standards are less well suited at the beginning of the innovation process, there's lots of new ideas going on. We don't want to lock anything into a standard. We're not ready to say yes this must be the block size. Or yes this must be the format in which things are expressed. While innovation is running, that's the great time to be incubating possible standards and identifying places where you might need coordination. Not yet the time to write it into this is a global recommendation for the web.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid21" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid22" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>So I wanted to briefly mention some of the work that the W3C is already doing that might be relevant to work that you're looking at. In security and privacy, we have been working in web authentication, web crypto, web application security, web payments, privacy IG, HTML (web platform WG), web performance, CSS, HTML media, WebRTC.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid23" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid24" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Web authentication is one of the newer pieces of work that came over that came over to W3C from Fido Alliance. Username and password is a terrible way to auhtenticate, yet it's done everywhere on the web. HOw can we get beyond that? The web authenticaiton working group is building the web APIs to act as the interface between the local authenticator, the web client, and the reliant party, the big arrow between your local client which might be a web browser on a client, and the website which is relying party. This will be one module of a larger authorization framework that we are building a way to do strong authentication from the web client.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid25" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid26" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Another piece of work is PKLjs. It's in the candidate recommendation stage, the Web Crypto API. Instead of inviting every web developer to write his or her own javascript crypto libraries, we're building an API standard across the browsers, rather than, building the implementation, we're standardizing what that API looks like so that a call to encrypt or decrypt, or verify,&nbsp;</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid27" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid28" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>This is something that a ... move forward to a recommendation, but the API is extensible and if there are additional algorithms needed, then this is a good place to build for those. Lots of work in our WebAppSec working group. If you're building web applications and want to assure that others are not injecting cross-site scripting attacks (XSS) and data theft attacks, and various APIs design in WebAppSec help to secure web applications, make it easier for the authors of webapps to deploy securely and rely on the transport layer security of HTTPS. And places to think about if you're developing applications in the browser, looking into webappsec APIs and designs.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid29" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid30" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Again, support for encryption everywhere because we believe that a strong web is one where people can rely on end-to-end security and integrity protection. We support HTTPS with browser-side features.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid31" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid32" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>We have web payments work that is building up a payment request API. That's looking across payment types. If you're here because you're interested in bitcoin or cryptocurrency, then look into the Web Payments work to see whether that is extensible in the ways that you would need to work to support alternative currencies, whether it's by default the protocol will support payment and does it include the payment features or is it extensible to include the payment features that you might need for a cryptocurrency? Along with the basic payment request API, there are payment method identifiers and basic card payment in progress on payment applications to support that API.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid33" class=""><br></div>

So thanks very much and thank you again for coming to share your ideas at this workshop.</p></span></div>

Keep it with you. What is this particular pattern of greatness? See if you can't embody it or can't recommend it ofr find it in the next two days. I would like each of you to tell a story about a collaboration that was really meaningful to you. It could be a business effort, it could be another team in your company, or it could be a personal collaboration that you found really powerful. Please share three minutes about a story of collaboration that you found very powerful. The time is now 9:23. Let's do this for 15 minutes. It's a 5 person table, then 3 minutes each.</p></span></div>

<div id="magicdomid51" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Someone should be a scribe at each table. Someone should be a facilitator at each table. Someone needs to make sure the table is going to be on time. Your job is to put down on that sheet of paper, three bits of secret sauce, something that was just marvelous and wonderful and why it is was wonderful and what made it work that you think other people should know about. Just put the three of them on a sheet of paper. They should be in the form of a story that tells a lesson. My group did xyz and it was failing, and then we did this magic trick and then boom it worked. (That seems like an unreasonable requirement.) Something-- secret sauce. At my table, each story had something like "oh this was something we did that made this marvelous". We want each table to find three secret sauces. One story from the whole table. My card is "inquiry and synthesis". It has this spiral on the top of it. The idea is that you have this, you told some stories, you have some common things, you heard some different things, the table should decide what are the three most important things? The last thing you will do in the next 15 minutes is pick just one to present to everyone. You will pick one of those three and say this is what I think everyone in this room needs to hear. You will have 2 to 2.5 minutes to share that one one wonderful piece of trick or secret sauce of collaboration to everybody in the orom. Each table has to decide what is the story you want to present to everyone.</p></span></div>

We were thinking of a story like rock band in the way, that as a band comes together, the creative tension of each member helps the taste of the other. They write great songs, and when they break apart the leader song-writer just doesn't have the magic anymore. A healthy amount of friction is a good thing.</p></span></div>

One of the things I learned during training is that in our group, which was important, was shared problem statement that is an evolving document where you first spend a lot of time to formulate an actionable measurable problem that everyone agrees on. The measures you have at hand to solve that problem. So that's one thing that we thought about in our table to actually make sure that what you do and what you come up with in the end solves the problem that you agreed on in the first place.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid68" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid69" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Table 4: We talked about the mechanics of collaboration. The thing that we thought most important to share is that it's important to recognize when you're finished and when to stop. I am sure we all know groups and areas and something that is failing and everyone is just flobbing it. We did a good job, but now that thing is finished and that standards bodies don't need to hire 20 people because that job was finished. I am sure we all have a personal anecdote about this from work or private relationships. Knowing when to stop and leave a group and go do something else is actually important for collaboration.</p></span></div>

Our story is that several decades ago, there was a guy that was going to go to the moon, they were rivals with this other team that wanted to go to the moon. There was this collaboration versus competition. You want this cult-like aspect in collaboration where everyone is united against a common enemy and has this above-and-beyond motivation. And then you achieve that. So the story is that they went to the moon, walked around and came back. It was fun. Those are the aspects. You want competition and collaboration. They really go hand-in-hand. In a lot of cases, you want motivation that might not be rational. This is common in many technologies like blockchain and bitcoin, people are kind of crazy about it. I was not around for the first web standards, and I bet there were a lot of crazy people. Those are the secrets to collaboration.</p></span></div>

<div id="magicdomid77" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Our top three were having a common goal. Flexibility and diversity. Having diverse teams where people bring different social and technical skills to the table. The final one was one trust through facing common challenges and having a common mission. Hi. The story I want to tell is about trust. It happened right here at MIT about 5-6 years ago. In the winter, a very famous professor was giving a class, and there was going to be a workshop and then 2.5 days or 3 days later, as we were probing ideas for what to do for this hackathon, there were 4 people that couldn't find a place. This was a large group. One of the facilitators talked to one of the four, I was one of the four, you four are misfits, let's put you together and see if you gel. The four of us were indecisive, we had never met, we sat down and talked, let's, if you guys trust me then I will trust you, and I don't leave anyone behind. One person said well that suits me, I don't leave anybody behind, and then it became the team and we had all sorts of breakdowns and services and data and people are bailing out of the team and we worked many axe I can't think work too hard, and we finished our project at the last minute in the blue room when everything clicked, we went in, and it was just the three of us, and people thought we had nothing. But we got it. It was the trust that made it work. We walked away from our egos and everything. When you have a common goal, and you really want it to work, it works.</p></span></div>

In this case, the organization that closes the customer takes the initiative of the problem. They decide to, in order to make it, to explain it to them and communicate to other organizations and other patterns. They break silos and then they are able to present. So that's our solution. Breaking down of information, and also taking ownership of the issue.</p></span></div>

<div id="magicdomid90" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>We seem to have two 9s. We are sidestepping proprietary interest and stale thinking. There were a couple of examples. One was from degrees that MIT has a blockchain-based degree issuance and the way that collaboration came together, it was critical that nobody owned the result. And that's also the experience that I have had in trying to bring together essentially legal and tech. And their endless conversations with various groups that do have ownership interests, they proceed slowly, then suddenly a few group of students in the law school picked the thing up, taught themselves, and now they are charging ahead. They don't own any of the ecosystem yet, so they are not inhibited by the problem of who owns. It might be, as I think our keynote has commented on a wonderful tweet, it might be the that the blockchain solves the ownership problem by using permissionless innovation. It's about shedding the concern about who owns the ecosystem.</p></span></div>

Nobody was using it until 2010 because it wasn't in all the browsers. Before it was in all the browsers, there was an Adobe plugin, which allowed a large community to play with this and see what you were doing. You could change the code, see in the browser the changes immediately. That encouraged a lot of play and experimentation. If it weren't for that early phase of having that plugin, that thing in the browser that everyone could use that was widely deployed, then it wouldn't have had any legs to carry it into the long slog of getting into each browser. Another user story from our table was that your first bitcoin transaction, to be able to do that your first time, is really empowering experience. Letting people play with the tech, giving it into their hands, and having something that they can viscerally experience for themselves is a really important part for the community building adoption.</p></span></div>

We have journalists. We have an interesting mix of people. Someone was presenting an idea once. The computer scientists immediately found security holes in what they were talking about. This offended the presenter. The comp sci people said this is what we do, we find rough edges. I think the point is that setting up the conversation is important. In this case, it's very important for the journalist and the scientist or whatever type of research these people do, understand how we are going to communicate in this meeting. If I should tell these people that hey there's a point where I am going to be putting on my security researchre hat, and I will attack your idea like that, then maybe that should be told to the speaker. So that yo ucan recognize the interesting things behind the idea, you should also put on your cap that isn't for security. Setting up the conversation might be important. These assumptions about putting on these hats is really important to get messages across.</p></span></div>

We had some of us talk about our different areas, which was having an open doors policy literally. Another person had the opportunity to have an open forum with artists and engineers were invited. Just having diverse groups finding common ground through mutual discovery, defaulting to open, and having an end goal and connecting through impact.</p></span></div>

Because of the business interest, because it was one company, we had the backing of a bank, and Samson Pay was one of the payment options on Samson. We tried to solve the problem for that band. It worked. The solution was there. After few years in browser, I learned that any solution for web is a disaster, it's not going to work. So we joined the payment group, we shared our experience, and in 8 or 10 months, we had just more diverse group looking at this, more eyeballs trying to solve that problem and more use cases. The collaboration blew our mind it's just the best way it could happen. No matter what, openness is the way to go.</p></span></div>

The team was building out on other people's stories. So that worked out really well. We had a story where you could give negative feedback to build consensus. We talked about going into details and getting down to the model level that really matters, and once you get there, you get to the consensus type that W3 operates at. Also experience with cloud sourcing, and building that out in terms of building a larger source of consensus. We had that talked about. Getting the context. Helping people to realize what exactly they are trying to agree on, and building that context with that foundation and you can build on that agreement.&nbsp; You can build out on that experience, and finally we agreed on the storyline on in corporate .. which is called... and here you have to build consensus among people who are actually illiterate, and they used to sell milk individually and to agree and get together arms and across religions and across towns to build out a cooperative society that would work together with each other preserving individual interest as well as the community interest as a whole. The idea behind the story is that if you build the bigger vision, and can show that personal interest can multiply, if the group has a lot of parallels in blockchain and the themes we are seeing with the DAO where if individual interest can be held back a little bit for a later time, and the group interest can be suppoted for a little while longer, then we can... and with that we hope we can build consensus as well.

This is turning out to be one of the more unusual and interesting events that I have been to. Someone at my table called the first session a quasi-religious experience. Not sure whether that was a good thing or not. Joking aside, my favorite thing about this is that the position statements were available on the website. I found them fascinating. I recommended them to my grad students. I read all the position statements. My comments today are going to be influenced by them. There were lots of good ideas there. Lots of convergent themes.</p></span></div>

Think of this as a conversation starter, influenced by your position statements. I am going to share some of my excitement for why I think there is a unique opportunity for standardization in web and blockchain and vice versa. In particular, how it might be possible to marry the power of blockchain with the reach of the web. I want to see if there's a way to get that, to de</p></span><span class="author-a-z72zkz77z2z83zkz71zwq4jmwyed b"><p>mocratize </p></span><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>blockchain. That's going to be the broad theme.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid134" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid135" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Before I get into that, I want to discuss a skeptical point. What's ready for standardization? Is it too soon? Is it too premature? I don't have an answer for that. The role here for me is to not give answers. I want to address a small component. From a computer science perspective, one question which we can ask is are bitcoin and other blockchains sound? Are they going to be around in 10 or 20 years? I think it's important to know the answer to that question to some degree of confidence. As an academic comp sci researcher, I can bring something to the table about this.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid136" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid137" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Research in bitcoin in particular has been vibrant in the academic community. This is a Google Scholar search for the number of papers mentioning bitcoin. Per year the number is in thousands. In 2013, it exploded. This does not mean that all of these are papers totally about bitcoin. I would estimate 100 per year that are really serious abit bitcoin, people analyzing the properties of the system.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid138" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid139" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Why am I talking about bitcoin not blockchain? There is relatively little of substance that you can say applies to all blockchain without being specific about one particular blockchain. Can we be successful about abstracting away specific properties about blockchains? There has been vibrant research in academia, to try to find unerlying problems in the system. What is the result of all of that? I would summarize it with three points. One is that, so far this is just my opinion and looking at all 3000 papers, well except Bryan... There have been no major unsolved problems found so far. There are various known concerns. The best known is selfish mining. Some of you may have heard about that. It's one of several other potential such problems, discovered by academics and others in the bitcoin research community.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid140" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid141" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>One piece of good news is that even though there are problems that have come out of a theoretical analysis, it seems that bitcoin has been working much better in practice than it should be. People are getting wise to this. People are refining their theoretical models to better model and predicft an figure out why bitcoin is continuing to work in practice. This is something positive from the point of view of standardization. The underlying tech is ready. From a teaching perspective, myself and others at princeton did an online course on bitcoin, we had 35k students. We did a textbook. Many professors are seeing bitcoin as a good way to introduce crypto and comp sci ideas to undergraduates. I think these ideas are going to get a lot of traction. I think we're going to have a lot of resources to draw on.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid142" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid143" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>I would offer one caveat, which is end-point security. What do I mean by this? People getting hteir servers hacked, losing bitcoin, companies going down because of securit y issues. This is different from bitcoin stability itself. Endpoint security so far has been pretty miserable. We all know this. Also, this came out yesterday, it's called the blockchain graveyard, it's from someone at Coinbase taking about a lot of different websites that have gone under because of security problems and ways that we can learn from that.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid144" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid145" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Human-crypto interaction is an unsolved problem. Not clear whether we will solve this for mainstream users to handle keys securely. Is it possible to abstract away those details from end-users, if we want to really democratize blockchains and marry it with the power and reach of the web.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid146" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid147" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Another caveat is the amount of research and the conclusions like bitcoin versus ethereum. Ethereum is a much newer system, not much research so far, but also compared to bitcoin there is some concern about the fundamental security of the system, both about underlying security and so on. Bitcoin has been remarkably successful at alinging this... with Ethereum there has been some concern about people's ability to reason about smart contracts and writing them in a secure way. As you might have heard there was the recent DAO problems. Cornell researchers have been pointing this out for a long time at this point. There is vibrant academic research in these communities. Ethereum research is going to be in a different place in a few years, but at this point I would say there are concerns about stability and security of the system.</p></span></div>

<div id="magicdomid149" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Can standaridzation enable new apps? Sometimes we standardize document formats. That's really important, apps can then talk with each other, that's important. But sometimes standardization enables fundamentally new things. At the introduction of Cookies for the Web, it's coupled with browser functionality that is fairly trivial, sending a cookie to the server each time, but it fundamentally altered the character of the web. It made a lot of other apps possible. It had some negative effects as well though. We can exploit this in the blockchain world when combining it with the web. Could a little bit of browser functionality enable something totally new?</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid150" class=""><br></div>
<div id="magicdomid151" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>I am going to give an example of somewhere that I think this might be possible. It's to prove the point that something like this might be possible. I want you to imagine 5 to 10 years in the future. A user, through a web browser, or an IoT device that is web-enabled, and they are interacting with a service provider. They issue a command to do something on the blockchain. I will make that more concrete in a minute. It's an untrusted server. The client does not trust the server. This is a thin client, denoted by the stick figure here. In bitcoin, there are thin clients and so on, where the clients do not have much functionality, they want to rely on the servers but don't want to trust it. The server carries out the task. But in addition, it's enabled by the blockchain to say I've done that, and here's the proof. The notion of proof is one of the cool things that blockchain enables. This is something that we need to keep in mind during standardization. In this vision of the future, imagine the browser showing a green lock in the address bar, the user doesn't need ot know much else, it handles the verification of the proof and then the user is convinced that the command has been successfully completed on the blockchain. Imagine what kind of world this would enable. I read all of your position statements. There were many threads about contracts, not just smart contracts but legal contracts timestamping on the blockchain, provenance both for creative content but also IP and assets, lots of people excited about IoT like from IBM and BT and so on. Identity was another important thread here. Think about any of these applications. Think about renting an apartment, you are renting, you walk t othte landlord, the landlords computer connects to a backend server which is connected to the blockchain. You signed a blockchain transaction, and... who's phone is that? Your landlord timestamps that on the blockchain, it beams through bluetooth, your phone being a thin client not a node</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid152" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;on the network would still be able to through your browser trust a web-based interface to convince you the user that the landlord has done this correctly and that the document you just signed was timestamped on the blockchain. You could imagine this for creative content too. If we enable this through blockchain, this enables the use of the blockchain with just anyone with just a browser, without interacting with the underlying crypto. What is the language for that? What are the set of things we want to express? When the server sends a proof back to the client, what does that mean? Is that a browser add-on? What is the user interface that the proof has been correctly verified? We have to figure out how to operationalize this. The power that this is going to unlock is going to be really tremendous. Today, with or without standards, I don't think we have anything like this that is possible.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid153" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid154" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;As an aside, when I say proofs here, what do I mean? I want to show you a simple technical example of how these proofs work. The simplest possible proof is where the client says to the server to put a piece of data on the blockchain and the server sends back proof. Visually, this is what the blockchain looks like. You have seen merkle trees with pointers pointing to different blocks. So the data you write is going to be this node in the merkle tree over here. So what does it mean for a server to prove to you? This is what I mean by "efficient proofs". This is enabled by merkle trees. The server can only give you the pieces of data highlighted here. You don't have to care about most of the 70 gigs in the blockchain. You only have to care about a small logarithmic amount of data. This will allow thin clients to verify this by looking at hash pointers, looking for 6 confirmations in the blockchain, and then confirm that the data was written to the blockchain. The server does the work, you don't trust it, but you can be cryptographically convinced that it is acting correctly.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid155" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid156" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;Another scenario is about identity where the client wants to ask a question to the server, prehaps a question about a friend, the user knows the handle, the server can provide an answer like a pubkey. What we can make possible is, here I am borrowing a grpahic from blockchainme. Imagine if a server could send a sum representation of this identity info back to the client and the client's trusted web interface could verify this information and the client could simply trust what they are seeing is reflecting what's on the blockchain. I think we should be able to enable this. Standardization should be able to bypass the messy process of human crypto verification, like users having to check signatures and so on and so forth.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid157" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid158" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;Let me give you one more technical example of a slightly more complex proof. This is the sort of thing that you can imagine in a system like namecoin. The client could ask what is the IP address corresponding to a domain name? This is a blockchain based replacement for the centralized ICANN domain name system. The client asks for the IP for a domain, the server says here is a record that maps the domain to the IP. That domain name might have changed hands. The server has to prove an additional statement that there is no future record after this record that pertains to this dot bit domain name. This will not work with a simple merkle tree proof like I showed earlier. To enable broader applications, this serves a quesiton like, should we standardize the simple proofs, or should standardize a language for proofs similar to ethereum's system which is turing complete?</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid159" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid160" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;There was a proposal for fidicuiacry signatures, where the authors have put a lot of thought towards proofs. These questions should be addressed.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid161" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid162" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>Let's take this a little bit further. Verifiers could be offline. Think about the typical IoT space. Think of a car that can be opened by a digital key. We can enable the following scenario. If you want to loan your car to a friend for a period of the day, in this hypothetical world you could have a USb-based car key, with a USB port where you could upload information related to signatures in the blockchain, and this car key could communicate by bluetooth to the car and be able to open it. The car queries the key and asks for some proofs, the key gives a proof to the car that the key is authorized to drive the car for a period of time. The car could verify this information including proof-of-work and so on.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid163" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid164" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;I do want to present a caveat. If you are offline, then you are going into a weaker security model. Some people are uncomfortable with thin bitcoin clients, because of the weaker security properties. But my position is that the opportunity is enormous, and we should fix the security properties instead of moving away from these scenarios altogether. We can put this into every IoT device, not just cars but also toasters. What if we could do this without having to connect it, what about just only putting a thin client on to each device? I am sure most of you follow the Internet of Shit twitter account, which catalogs all the disasters related to putting internet access into toasters. If you don't know what this is, then you should go follow that twitter account, that's the most important takeaway from this talk. Many companies here are interested in marrying the blockchain with IoT and I am interested in hearing what they think is appropriate here.</p></span></div>

<div id="magicdomid166" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;I want to make a few more points. It does matter which blockchain we're talking about. Imagine a client telling the server to do something on the blockchain, and the server communicates back a proof. Even if it's the case that you can standardize this part here, this word proof here is going to be difficult to standardize across different ledgers. If you do that, you have only solved half the problem. One of the example where this goes into play is public vs private blockchain. Permit me for a moment to deconstruct private blockchains here. I am going to use private blockchain and permissioned ledgers as the same term here. What do private blockchain have in common and what do they have different to bitcoin blockchain? They still use an appended log with hash pointers and merkle trees. They threw away proof-of-work and nakamoto consensus which is the primary innovation of bitcoin, and they dispense with currency. So some of them use Byzantine consensus protocol work instead, like fault-tolerant praxos stuff. This is a different technical configuration. Most of the technical components in private blockchains go back decades in the computer science literature. People were putting roots of merkle trees in the newspaper, before people heard about blockchain. There was a company that puts the root hash as an advertisement in the newspaper, called guardtime. Most of these concepts have a pedigree going back for decades.</p></span></div>

<div id="magicdomid168" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>&nbsp;I want to point out a funny tweet. This explains why private blockchains have been so successful.&nbsp; Steve Wilson. "Blockchain is a stone soup for capital markets technology". All of the underlying actual technical components from private blockchains go back to the 80s and 90s in the computer science literature. Private blockchains don't use Nakamoto consensus. What the blockchain is going to be able to prove to you about its operations is going to be totally different for public and private blockchain. It's going to be completely different. The proofs are going to be fundamentally different. The standards are going to be probably incompatible. Some people have proposed interlinking different ledgers together. However, these ledgers have vastly different security properties. What happens to the security properties when we do this?</p></span></div>

<div id="magicdomid170" class=""><span class="author-a-m5z88zb58z65zwz85zz80zz71zz84zz88zz85zod b"><p>A note of caution, if you have heard me speaking on this topic before then you would have guessed that I woud go here. Seeking tech solutions to social problems. I want to read one quote from Angela Walsh, from one of the submissions, like I said I read all the submissions. "When messing with public property and finance records, you're messing with the records of private individuals. We need to keep this in mind how dangerous this can be." Standardization can act as a key check to prevent us from seeking technical solutions to social problems. This offers us an opportunity for introspection. Is this tech going to be applicable to everyone? What are the costs? Can we think about the potential harms of this tech? It also acts as a point of regulation. And finally, it imparts legibility. What I mean here is that standardization is while primarily a process of getting computers together, the process of documenting and specifying what we're doing, allows this tech to be legible to lawyers and regulators who want to come in and have a discussion about how we're using this tech in our world. These two days here are for technical discussion, but more broadly we should have an opportunity to think about blockchain in society.</p></span></div>

<div id="magicdomid1159" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>One was creating a new API or updating an existing API for Web Auth or an expansion to the web auth spec, where the browser would understand blockchain-based identity. We want to resolve and display blockchain identity in the browser, anything identified as an identity in a blockchain in a browser. Request payload signature. Apps receiving payloads could check from the user. Those are the four areas we are interested in pursuing for standards.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1160" class=""><h1></h1><h1><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Blockchain standardization proposals</p></span></h1></div>
<div id="magicdomid1161" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>These are actual proposals to start work at W3C or IETF perhaps. I am going to kind of list the proposals. We are going to write each one of these proposals up here for the dot voting segment. These are in priority order. These are in priority order where things people were most interested in. Blockchain receipts was up there at the time. IPLD. Semantic vocabularies and ontologies for blockchain. Folks felt like we need a blockchain interest group at W3C to steer this work. There was a discussion around smarter signatures that Christopher and Peter are going to take that stuff up. Expressing digital assets in decentralized systems. Libp2p which is interfaces for p2p protocols, peer discovery, peer transports, a URI format for blockchain networks, key management in the browser, cryptographic key management in the browser, proof-of-existence, generalized lite client header proofs, ways of expressing and using deterministic keys, the multiformat from IPFS like multihash multicodec multiaddr etc. There was discussion around exposing core network primitives like udp and bluetooth or NFC. There was a proposal for a blockchain gateway interface. The next steps are to put these proposals up here, and then based on the dot voting there would be some indication of the priority that folks would like to assign to them.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1162" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Q: Key management in the browser? This would be the 4th attempt for W3C. What are we going to do different this time?</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1163" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>A: I don't know. There seems to be more pressure for this. I don't think there was a concrete proposal about what that would be. The field has changed. We would like to have that discussion again.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1164" class=""><h1></h1><h1><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Legal implications</p></span></h1></div>
<div id="magicdomid1165" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>The proposition we considered was that legal docs, consider them as we do open-source software or documents. Systematic doc at a time. Specifically we discussed challenges around blockchain as a communication channel. How do you legally secure that? There has been no legal framework established as of yet. Our friend working with the Chinese bank mentions that they are extremely conservative and want it to be governed appropriately. Myself, working at a nuiversity, our office of general counsel is swamped using old syschronatic methods. We were looking at some next steps, we were looking at Common Accord as a core for a solution or a beginnings of a solution, coming up with a common record format. We talked aobut pagerank for transactions. If you are dealing with audits, it would be nice to have a weighted average like the amount, neutrality, identity, and the amount. We also talked about standards that don't exist but ought to, our friend Eric brought up that ISO has been recently looking at ISO TSP 2508 which has been looking at whether they need to get involved in blockchain. They are looking at a 50% vote to go ahead with a few countries. Looks like July 14th end date for responses.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1166" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Q: Is any of that up on the board?</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1167" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>A: Shortly.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1168" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Q: Pagerank for transactions?</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1169" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>A: It's a notion of centrality of the transaction. In blockchain, a transaction has a connection, we can calculate centralities up to the second depth, connected to the weighted address, we can add more weight that can be part of the address, and we can calculate the size and amount and distance from the genesis block. Ratio of changes of amounts. This can be a calculated effect. We don't know who own the addresses, and the auditor or regulator are able to screen which address has importancy and we are- that is my thinking.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1170" class=""><h1></h1><h1><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Smart signatures</p></span></h1></div>
<div id="magicdomid1171" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Our table brought together Interledger's Crypto Conditions and petertodd's and mine's DEX for deterministic expressions. At the end of the discussion, we settled that they are compatible and we ought to make them work together. We got some additional requirements from crypto conditions that we will try to resolve with DEX. There is some discussion about bringing it to IETF in July in Berlin so maybe I will be going to Berlin after all to see whether there is any interest there. If not, then we might bring it to W3C.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1172" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Q: What was the discussio nabout?</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1173" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>A: Crypto conditions is a structure. DEX is a simple language. So the discussion was can we get their bitmask in the beginning to let you know that something has an RSA operation in the expression, or there is an ECDSA operation in there, do you support the bitcoin curve or whatever? Those things can be prepended to the structure that allows an evaluator to know that it doesn't even want to attempt to evaluate the expression, whereas in DEX you have to evaluate it to determine if there were things in it you might not understand.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1174" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>DEX thing commits to the operations. Instead of pre-caching the parsing. But long expressions wont be too long.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1175" class=""><h1></h1><h1><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Security</p></span></h1></div>
<div id="magicdomid1176" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>..... We talked about TheDAO and governance and the implementation. Separation of hash and execution so splitting the different parts to make them hardened and secure.&nbsp; Understanding the risk when you execute something, to have some sort of measure. We went back to Matsuo's slide which had different levels of the stack and it had the standards that you should apply to that layer in the stack. It was a great slide so we had a discussion about that. The stack had implementation and application and cryptography layers. So the outcome of this discussion was that we need to be able to have some implementation layer that can be tested, and cryptography can be evaluated and analyzed so that we have an assurance that the code is secure. We need more research to do a fine-grained analysis. Some parts of the stack are too compact and there's no way to evaluate it clearly. Fine-grained layering of the security stack would be useful. Finally, looking at, coming from the cloud world, we have organization like cloud security alliance which gives us a best practice in terms of security and we couldn't find an equivalent in blockchain. We thought it would be good if there were some initiative like that which would allow us to understand the way to implement security from day 1.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1177" class=""><h1></h1><h1><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>IoT</p></span></h1></div>
<div id="magicdomid1178" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>The next steps could be, one is pretty clear that there isn't a good categorization of devices. There needs to be work to categorize those devices. There are probably many dimensions on how to do it. One could be by footprint and size, other could be by mobile versus fixed, third could be by longevity which is what I talked about in my slides, another could be spatial or temporal dimensions. This is an important body of work that ought to be done. The second is that, broadly phrased, the integrity of devices and transactions from a user interface perspective. The vision is that transactions would be happening rapidly, and how does a user keep control for stuff that should be reconfigured? And the third thing is, some of the key words that came up in the discussion was, and not all exhaustive, indexing, declaring, making data available in a standardized manner. I think that's another important body of work that is just missing. And a little bit related, is the whole area of discovery of a device, addressing a device, directory services, what's the equivalent of DNS for the IoT world. The registration of a device, provisioning, and a lifecycle standpoint should also be considered to organize all of these events and states.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1179" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>There were some other sentiments expressed. What's unnecessary centralization? What's the right amount of centralizaiton when it comes to devices? Identity is separate from reputation or trust. Again different categories of devices. Different categories of devices would change that. Another one was delegation, the concept that for in order for things to scale, you have to deal with lot more devices than we might want to deal with on a one-by-one basis. Avoiding surveillance and considerations regarding surveillance. Pretty much I think that, that was kind of the overview of sentiments that were expressed.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1180" class=""><h1></h1><h1><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Lightning network</p></span></h1></div>
<div id="magicdomid1181" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>We were initially the table with crypto conditions but then we split up. We talked about interoperability like interledger and lightning network and how these networks on top of blockchains would look. There were some very differnet perspectives. Some people were from the crypto bitcoin blockchain side, and some others had more experience with traditional finance. There were some similarities with problems and how we deal with it.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1182" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>What does the topology of these networks look like? Will they look like a star topology, or a well distributed graph? Do you want it to be a well-distributed graph? In the web case, it started off with everyone running their own servers, and now you have a very long tail and it's definitely a power law distribution where the top 10 sites get 90% of the total visits. There are reasons to look at this either way. We also talked about not necessarily how to make standards, a lot of these projects are not standards ready and they are not operational yet, still in development, but standards between ledgers, currencies and blockchains, and how to get existing financial institutions to say, we don't have a blockchain but we will accept some of the same crytpo conditions that a blockchain has maybe. Like saying yes we will move money if you give us a digital signature, getting a bank to say that now even ahead of blockchain integration would be really helpful for the upcoming massive migrations required by upgrades to these new technologies.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1183" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>How can companies do risk management and how can the legal aspects work too? It's good conversation. A lot of the conversation was about how this could potentially work. A lot of this is still early.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1184" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Q: You say it's not ready for standardization. Would incubation help? Is it still in a phase where you are working on projects, or is it at the point where starting a conversation might lead down to 2 years down the road? We can prioritize things based on their urgency and readiness. We can also be thinking longer-term about how does this fit into the larger thing.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1185" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>A: Standardization is important. Right now we're still trying to figure out what works. A lot of this is education.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1186" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>As an admin note, if you have pages of notes or something, we will record those either by photograph or typing.</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1187" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>Q: You said, I thought it was important, you said you don't think some of this is ready. What would be ready? I would be interested to hear your sense. What are the aspects that you think seems not ready. It's easy to get caught up and moving forward with momentum. What are the signs that make you think it's not ready?</p></span></div>
<div id="magicdomid1188" class=""><span class="author-a-6z65z2ofz79zgax56z67zaamq b"><p>A: I think it was sort of the idea that you want things that are operational. You want a descriptive standard rather than a prescriptive standard. I am not experienced with W3C. It seems like that's the idea. A lot of these technologies are not being used widely. People are talking with companies, we are building things, but we have no idea what the network is going to look like. Let's see how it works in real life first.</p></span></div>
